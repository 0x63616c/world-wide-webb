/**
 * Battery readout for the settings Device section, via @capacitor/device.
 *
 * Polls while `enabled` (the settings modal is open) , the wall panel sits on
 * dock power, so the interesting signal is "still charging?" rather than a
 * fast-moving percentage. In a plain browser / Storybook the plugin has no
 * native side and this resolves to null, which the row renders as unavailable.
 * Mirrors the dynamic-import pattern in app-update.ts so the Capacitor module
 * stays out of the main bundle path.
