/**
 * Bridge between the durable job queue and the Worker contract.
 *
 * A job type does not need its own dispatch machinery: the worker runtime
 * already guarantees a cycle never overlaps itself (per-type concurrency 1),
 * that each worker owns an independent timer chain (a 1h download cannot delay
 * `notify`), and that a throwing cycle never kills a sibling. So a job type is
 * simply a Worker whose cycle drains that one type.
 *
 * Both the per-job timeout and the reaper's lease derive from the same JobSpec,
 * so there is one declared number per type rather than two constants to drift.

 * `queued`. This is the only mechanism that recovers those.
 *
 * Scoped to `status = 'running'` on purpose: rows deliberately parked in
 * `queued` on a future run_after must never be resurrected by a sweep.
 *
 * yt-dlp resumes from its .part file when re-run against the same output path,
 * so a requeued download continues rather than starting over.
 *
 * The ceiling on attempts lives here rather than on the claim SELECT: a process
 * death never reaches claimOne's own catch block, so a job that keeps killing
 * its worker (OOM, a poison payload) would otherwise be requeued and reclaimed
 * forever , and because claims order by priority DESC, created_at ASC, that
 * same row would be reselected first on every cycle, permanently crash-looping
 * the shared worker process out from under every other job type and enforcer
 * cycle it hosts. Rows at or past max_attempts are failed here instead, loudly,
 * rather than being silently parked (which `AND attempts < max_attempts` on the
 * claim SELECT would do , that hides the failure instead of recording it).
 *
 * Returns the number of rows requeued (does not count rows failed outright).
