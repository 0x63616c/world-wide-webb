/**
 * GitHub run-history retention purge (spec 2026-07-18-github-deploy-tile-design).
 * `github_run` accumulates one row per main workflow run; 30 days of history is
 * all the Deploys tile ever shows, so older rows (and their log tails) go.
 *
 * The github_poll_status singleton is NEVER touched here: it carries the
 * currently-deployed pointer, and purging it when the last deploy is >30 days
 * old would leave the tile unable to say what is deployed at all. Purge the
 * history, keep the pointer.
 *
 * Runs from the same daily one-shot purge CronJob as the other retention
 * sweeps (purge.ts), never a worker loop. Volume is trivial (a few hundred
 * rows a month), so a single bounded DELETE per table is enough , no batching.
