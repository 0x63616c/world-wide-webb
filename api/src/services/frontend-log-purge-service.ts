/**
 * Frontend-log retention purge (spec 2026-07-18-frontend-log-shipping-design).
 * `frontend_log` is append-only device debug logs shipped from every panel /
 * browser session, so it grows without bound. Retention is the size control
 * (all four levels ship, no level filtering), not backup — each device holds
 * its own copy.
 *
 * Retention policy:
 *  - frontend_log: KEEP 30 days, cut on `ts` (capture time). A row's ts only
 *    ever moves backward relative to now, so a ts cutoff can never delete a row
 *    a live query still wants (reads are always "recent" windows).
 *
 * Runs from the same daily one-shot CronJob as the portal + weather purges (see
 * purge.ts), never a worker loop (PRD Backend rule 7). Deletes are BATCHED for
 * the same reason as the weather purge: a single unbounded DELETE would hold one
 * long transaction and bloat WAL. Whatever a run doesn't finish is picked up by
 * the next day's run.
