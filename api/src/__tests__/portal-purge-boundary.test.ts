/**
 * Row-level predicate boundary tests for the portal purge (www-q002.18 hardening,
 * password-only since www-p9hx). These prove the EXACT cutoff a row is purged at,
 * so a flipped comparator or an off-by-one in the retention math fails a test
 * instead of silently deleting live data. The pure predicate helper below is the
 * single source of truth that the SQL WHERE clause mirrors 1:1.
