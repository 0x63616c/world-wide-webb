# Control Center post-cutover smoke checks (www-jtp0.7.9).
#
# Run AFTER the production data cutover (www-jtp0.7.7) to prove the live stack came
# back healthy against the product CNPG: api reachable, workers registered and
# looping, integrations heartbeating, media-worker in its EXPECTED state (running
# OR intentionally parked at replicas: 0 per DESIGN §10), NAS/maps storage mounted,
# and the nightly backup able to complete against the product DB.
#
# Each check prints `PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP <name>: <detail>` and the script exits
# non-zero if any non-skipped check fails. It NEVER reads or prints a secret value.
# Designed to be run from a machine on the tailnet with kubectl context to homelab.
#
# Override the defaults via env (see --help). With CC_SMOKE_DRY_RUN=1 it prints the
# exact commands it WOULD run without touching the cluster (used by the hermetic
# test and for a no-side-effect preview).
