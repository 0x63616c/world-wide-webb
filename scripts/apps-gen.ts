/**
 * `apps:gen` collects the App model, validates it as one consistent whole, and
 * emits the committed `features/_generated/*.gen.ts` aggregates. The Board and
 * Tile Detail Host consume `web.gen.ts`; the remaining deployables consume their
 * own generated facets.
 *
 * THE BUN RUNTIME: `collect()` imports App manifests and Tile View facets, which
 * pull in the web TSX tree using the `@/*` path alias. Bare `bun` at the repo
 * root has no `@/*` mapping, so this script MUST be
 * run with cwd = apps/web, where bun natively reads apps/web/tsconfig.json's
 * `@/*` -> ./src/* mapping. The `apps:gen` package.json script does that
 * (`cd apps/web && bun run ../../scripts/apps-gen.ts`). Because cwd is then
 * apps/web, every path below is resolved absolutely from the repo root (derived
 * from import.meta.url), never from cwd.
 *
 * FORMATTING: no biome pass runs here. biome.json globally ignores gen files
 * (the `!**` + `.gen.ts` include-negation — generated artifacts are opaque to
 * lint/format), so a `biome format` on the
 * output is a no-op that also errors ("no files processed"). The emitter instead
 * produces canonical, already-formatted output directly (scripts/apps-gen/emit.ts),
 * which is what makes two runs byte-identical.
