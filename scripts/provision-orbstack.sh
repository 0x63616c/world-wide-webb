# Provisions the OrbStack VM on homelab to the spec this stack needs (www-jagy).
# Run ON homelab, as calum (NOT sudo , `orb config` is per-user):
#
#   ./scripts/provision-orbstack.sh           # apply
#   ./scripts/provision-orbstack.sh --check    # report only, change nothing
#
# Idempotent. Codifies what was previously a manual `orb config set` so the VM
# sizing survives a reinstall and is reviewable. Applying a memory change needs an
# OrbStack restart , this script bounces it ONLY if the value actually changed,
# and only after confirming the host NFS mount is up first (see ordering note).

# --- target spec -------------------------------------------------------------
# 4GB VM (memory_mib=4096). The box is 8GB and OrbStack is NOT its only tenant:
#
#     4096 MiB  OrbStack VM        (this script)
#   + 2048 MiB  Home Assistant VM  (infra/homelab/haos/start-haos.sh, HAOS_MEM)
#   + ~2048 MiB macOS itself
#   = 8192 MiB
#
# The previous 5120 target forgot the HAOS guest entirely, so the arithmetic only
# ever balanced on paper. In practice the live box had ALSO drifted to 6144 with
# nobody noticing , there was no repo checkout on the mini, so `--check` had never
# once run there. On 2026-07-24 that left the host with 60MB free and 640MB
# swapped while HA Core was down. Raising this value means lowering HAOS_MEM by
# the same amount; the two VMs are not independent.
#
# The real protection against a single container eating the VM is the per-service
# memory caps in deploy.config.ts (www-ke9a), NOT VM size , this is headroom, not
# the fix.
TARGET_MEM_MIB="${TARGET_MEM_MIB:-4096}"
# vCPUs kept at 8 (all cores). Decision: an RCU-stall came from a container
# pegging all cores AND starving the guest kernel, but the memory caps + watchdog
# (www-sizh) address that more directly than under-provisioning CPU would; dropping
# to 6 only helps if macOS itself is starved, which it isn't. Revisit if the host
# (not the VM) shows CPU starvation.

# BUG FIXED 2026-07-24: this used to be a bare `orb restart`, which is invalid ,
# `orb restart` requires a machine ID/name and exits non-zero with "no machines
# specified". So this script could set the config value but NEVER apply it, and
# since the apply step was the last line the failure was easy to miss. That is
# the likeliest reason the live box sat at memory_mib=6144 while the repo claimed
# 5120: someone set it by hand, and the script was incapable of correcting it.
#
# Bare `orb stop` (no args, no -f) stops the ENTIRE OrbStack service gracefully,
# which is what applying a VM config change requires. -f is deliberately NOT used:
# `orb stop --help` warns it "may cause data loss", and postgres lives in here.
