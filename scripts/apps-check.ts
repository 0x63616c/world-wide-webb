/**
 * `apps:check` drift guard (Task 3.4). Regenerates the codegen aggregates
 * in-memory using the SAME collect() -> validate() -> renderTiles() pipeline as
 * `apps:gen` (scripts/apps-gen.ts), then diffs each render against the
 * committed `features/_generated/*.gen.ts` file. Exits non-zero on drift.
 *
 * This closes the gap the 3.3 reviewer flagged: nothing previously asserted
 * that the committed tiles.gen.ts matches a fresh render of its source
 * (TILE_REGISTRY this slice; the per-feature manifests join in Slice 5).
 *
 * THE BUN RUNTIME: same constraint as apps-gen.ts. collect() imports apps/web's
 * TILE_REGISTRY, which pulls in ~40 tile TSX components using the `@/*` path
 * alias, resolvable only when bun's cwd is apps/web (it reads
 * apps/web/tsconfig.json's paths there). The `apps:check` package.json script
 * mirrors `apps:gen`'s `cd apps/web && bun run ...` pattern, so every path here
 * is resolved absolutely from the repo root via import.meta.url, never cwd.
 *
 * SCOPE: this slice only has `tiles.gen.ts` under features/_generated/ (the
 * router/guest-router/schema/crons gen files are deferred to Slice 5). AGGREGATES
 * below lists just that one file so Slice 5 can extend the checked set by
 * appending entries, not restructuring this module.
