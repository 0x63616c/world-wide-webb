/**
 * `apps:check` drift guard (Task 3.4). Regenerates the codegen aggregates
 * in-memory using the SAME collect() -> validate() -> renderTiles() pipeline as
 * `apps:gen` (scripts/apps-gen.ts), then diffs each render against the
 * committed `features/_generated/*.gen.ts` file. Exits non-zero on drift.
 *
 * Every committed aggregate, including the web runtime, must match a fresh
 * render of its App-owned source facets.
 *
 * THE BUN RUNTIME: same constraint as apps-gen.ts. collect() imports App
 * manifests and Tile View facets, which pull in the TSX tree using the `@/*` path
 * alias, resolvable only when bun's cwd is apps/web (it reads
 * apps/web/tsconfig.json's paths there). The `apps:check` package.json script
 * mirrors `apps:gen`'s `cd apps/web && bun run ...` pattern, so every path here
 * is resolved absolutely from the repo root via import.meta.url, never cwd.
 *
 * SCOPE: AGGREGATES covers every current feature aggregate plus the manage
 * extension allowlist artifacts. Keep this list in lockstep with apps:gen so a
 * new generated surface cannot land without an authoritative drift check.
