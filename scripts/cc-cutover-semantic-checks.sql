-- Control Center cutover semantic validation (www-jtp0.7.6 / www-jtp0.7.7).
--
-- Row counts (pg-snapshot-restore.sh) prove NOTHING moved silently; these
-- queries prove the moved data is SEMANTICALLY intact and the system is safe to
-- resume writing against. Run the IDENTICAL file against both the source
-- (pre-cutover, read-only) and the restored product CNPG, and diff the output.
--
-- Run:  psql -d control_center -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f scripts/cc-cutover-semantic-checks.sql
-- (or pipe through `kubectl exec ... -- psql ...`). Reads only; writes nothing.
--
-- Every block prints `check | <name>` then its rows so a plain `diff` of the two
-- captures is meaningful. A check that returns ZERO rows where the source had
-- rows is a RED flag (data dropped on restore).
