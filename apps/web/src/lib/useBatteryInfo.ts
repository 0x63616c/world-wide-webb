/**
 * Battery readout via @capacitor/device , used by both the settings Device
 * row (`enabled` only while that page is open)
 * (`enabled` for the panel's whole lifetime).
 *
 * The wall panel sits on dock power, so the interesting signal is "still
 * charging?" rather than a fast-moving percentage , hence a 15s poll rather
 * than something tighter. In a plain browser / a component harness the plugin has no
 * native side and this resolves to null, which callers render as unavailable.
 * Uses a dynamic import so the Capacitor module
 * stays out of the main bundle path.
