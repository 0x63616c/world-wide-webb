/**
 * PinChangeModal , the three-stage change-PIN machine (verify the current PIN,
 * enter a new one, confirm it) on its own surface.
 *
 * It used to live inline in a permanently-mounted card on the Security page,
 * which forced a fourth "PIN changed" stage with a *Change again* button: the
 * card had nowhere to dismiss to, so it had to offer something, and what it
 * offered was doing the whole thing over. On its own surface success is simply
 * the flow disappearing (#298) , the caller closes us and confirms on the row.
 *
 * Success is a beat, not a screen. A matching confirm holds the dialog on an
 * explicit "PIN changed" state , green chip, same success language the gate
 * uses when it unlocks , and only then dismisses itself. The dead-end *Change
 * again* button does not come back: the surface still leaves on its own. The
 * beat exists because the confirmation this replaced could be missed entirely,
 * appearing in the row's value slot AFTER the surface a person was looking at
 * had already vanished.
 *
 * The beat drops the pad, the stage dots and Cancel. They are inert by then ,
 * `digit` refuses input once it flips , but inert is not the same as looking
 * inert: a keypad and a *Cancel* under the words "PIN changed" read as a screen
 * still waiting for something. What is left is the sentence and nothing else.
 *
 * The machine itself is unchanged from the Security page version: a
 * mismatched confirm restarts the new/confirm PAIR rather than the whole flow
 * (re-verifying the current PIN you just proved is busywork); and `setPinCode`
 * fires only on a confirm that matches.
 *
 * NEVER log or persist the entered digits , see PinModalShell's header.
