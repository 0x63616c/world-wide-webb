/**
 * CC guard: a tile's registry `label` MUST equal the title it renders in its
 * TileHeader on the board. The minimap hover label, the centered-tile pan label,
 * and the "Open …" aria-label all derive from `label`, so any drift makes the
 * minimap name a tile something other than what the user reads on it (the exact
 * bug this guards against , "Weather" vs "Weather Now", "Events" vs "Upcoming").
 *
 * Each board tile hard-codes its title as a `title="…"` literal in its view's
 * TileHeader, so we read the view source at build time and assert that literal
 * matches the registry label. A source check (vs rendering) needs no per-tile
 * prop wrangling and pins the exact string. Clock is the sole exception: it's a
 * greeting tile with no static header title.
