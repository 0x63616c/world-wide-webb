// were FOLDED into the guest-wifi feature (Track C, C7): they now live in

// barrel (features/_generated/schema.gen.ts, which unions this file with every
// feature's schema.ts). Nothing in apps/api references them directly anymore.

// schema barrel (features/_generated/schema.gen.ts).

// Photo booth (the wall panel's on-demand camera) was FOLDED into the booth

// barrel (features/_generated/schema.gen.ts).

// ─── GitHub Actions deploy pipeline (www-github-deploy) ────────────────────
// githubRun, githubRunLogTail, githubPollStatus, GITHUB_POLL_STATUS_SINGLETON_ID
// were FOLDED into the deploys feature (Track C, Wave 2): they now live in
// features/deploys/schema.ts and reach drizzle-kit via the generated schema
// barrel (features/_generated/schema.gen.ts, which unions this file with every
// feature's schema.ts). github-purge-service.ts still purges the physical
// github_run/github_run_log_tail tables via raw SQL (table names unaffected by
// which schema.ts declares them), so no change was needed there.

// notification + devicePushToken (Notification Center) were FOLDED into the
// notif feature (Track C, S1): they now live in features/notif/schema.ts and
// reach drizzle-kit via the generated schema barrel (unions this file with
// every feature's schema.ts), same precedent as the deploys fold above.
