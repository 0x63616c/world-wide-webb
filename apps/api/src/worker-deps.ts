/**
 * Barrel of everything the worker app (@control-center/worker) needs from the api domain
 * (www-xjba). The worker package owns the scheduling framework + job registry;
 * the actual reconcile/ingest cycles, the env, and the migrator still live here
 * and are re-exported through the `@control-center/api/worker` subpath so worker has a
 * single, explicit import surface rather than reaching into internal paths.
 *
 * There is one barrel because there is one worker app: since media-worker was
 * folded into worker, that single process owns every loop and every job type ,
 * the home-control enforcers, the pollers, and the whole durable queue. Job
 * handlers are plain exported functions the entrypoint passes into jobWorker,
 * so what runs is readable at the call site rather than hidden in a registry.
 *
 * Interim: this barrel is the documented seam between worker and api. The planned
 * packages/core extraction (shared domain) will move these out of api and
 * delete this file; until then, keep the export surface minimal.
