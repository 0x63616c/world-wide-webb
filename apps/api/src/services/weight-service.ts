/**
 * Weight ingest — polls the HA Renpho BLE weight sensor and appends new
 * measurements. Deduped on TWO axes, because either alone is insufficient:
 * the measured_at unique index catches the same reading polled twice, and
 * isRepeatReading() catches an entity that re-emits an unchanged weight under a
 * fresh last_updated (which the index cannot see). The original claim here —
 * that the sensor state is simply unchanged between weigh-ins, so most cycles
 * insert nothing — held only while the entity behaved.
 * Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-weight-tile-design.md.
