/**
 * Portal data-hygiene purge (www-q002.18, password-only since www-p9hx). Deletes
 * portal rows that have served their purpose so the table doesn't grow unbounded.
 * Run as a DAILY CronJob (one-shot job), NEVER a worker loop (PRD Backend rule 7).
 *
 * Retention policy:
 *  - portal_authorization: KEEP until 90 days past expiry, because a lapsed row
 *    is what drives the SessionExpired screen for a returning device; only purge
 *    well after it stops being useful.
 *
 * The portal_rate_limit singleton is self-resetting (one row, scoped to a UTC
 * day) so it needs no purge. portal_code / portal_guest / portal_attempt were
 * removed when the portal went password-only (www-p9hx).
 *
 * The delete predicate is built from an injected clock so the cutoff is
 * deterministic and testable; the count is returned (and logged by the caller).
