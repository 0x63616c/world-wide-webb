 *      its thumbnail via a single yt-dlp call. NEVER re-transcodes , we pick the
 *      AV1 stream YouTube already serves.
 *   3. Records the file path, byte size, and duration in media_item.

/**
 * Download one video (audio is inside the muxed container) plus its thumbnail.
 *
 * YouTube serves video and audio as separate DASH streams above 360p; the `+`
 * in the selector makes ffmpeg mux them into one file. AV1 is preferred as the
 * most efficient codec YouTube serves; the fallback after `/` is a pre-combined
 * stream. We never re-encode -- both paths are stream copies.
 *
 * The output template is machine-keyed, not human-readable: the filename is the
 * video id and nothing else. YouTube ids are [A-Za-z0-9_-]{11}, so there is
 * nothing to sanitize -- no title length limits, no NAS-hostile characters, no
 * brackets in a title colliding with our own delimiters. The DB carries the
 * title and uploader, so it is the human index; the filesystem is just storage.
 *
 * The `yt-` prefix exists because a YouTube id may legitimately START with a
 * hyphen (two in the current playlist do), and a leading-dash filename is read
 * as a flag by most CLI tools.
 *
 * Because the path is derivable from the id alone, a file already on disk but
 * missing from the DB is self-healing: yt-dlp finds it, skips the download, and
 * the row is created pointing at the existing file.
 *
 * Everything lands FLAT under a single `youtube/` folder so ingest output stays
 * out of the media root next to wake-photos/booth-photos.
 *
 * @public - exported for unit testing so tests can mock the subprocess
