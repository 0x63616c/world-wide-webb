/**
 * Worker app entrypoint (www-xjba). No HTTP , this is its own deployable package
 * (@control-center/worker) and its own image (control-center-worker), running the
 * continuous reconcile/ingest loops the api used to start in-process. Splitting
 * it out of api keeps the api request-only and lets the loops build, ship,
 * scale, and restart on their own image (www-7d5b.1.2 promoted to a real app).
 *
 * The domain cycles (enforce lights/climate, sync fans, party, ingest weather)
 * still live in @control-center/api and are imported via its ./worker barrel; this package
 * owns only the worker framework (runtime/types) and the worker list below ,
 * which capability runs on what cadence. The eventual packages/core extraction
 * will dissolve the api dependency; until then this is the seam.
