/**
 * Weather-reading retention purge (Track C, Wave 7 fold — was apps/api's
 * weather-purge-service.ts). Both weather tables are append-only by design
 * (the ingest poller inserts a fresh row per forecast hour every cycle so
 * run-over-run forecast drift is preserved), which means they grow without
 * bound: ~192 hourly rows + 8 daily rows per cycle, 288 cycles/day, is roughly
 * 55k weather_reading rows/day forever.
 *
 * Retention policy:
 *  - weather_reading / weather_daily_reading: KEEP 30 days of history, cut on
 *    `recorded_at` (when we captured the row), NOT on target_hour/target_date.
 *    Rows describing future hours are always recently recorded, so a recorded_at
 *    cutoff can never delete a row the dashboard still reads
 *    (service.ts only queries from today/now forward).
 *
 * Runs from the S2 cron seam (a daily one-shot k8s CronJob), never a worker
 * loop (PRD Backend rule 7). Deletes are BATCHED: the first production run has
 * millions of rows to remove and a single unbounded DELETE would hold one long
 * transaction and bloat WAL. Each batch is its own statement; whatever a run
 * doesn't finish is picked up by the next day's run.
 *
 * jobs.ts exports ONLY this `defineCron` facet — weather-ingest is a Worker
 * interval, not a queue job, so this feature has no `defineJobs` facet.
