/**
 * The notify job facet (Track C, S1). Registers the APNs fan-out handler on
 * the S1 job seam: codegen collects this via `defineJobs`, emits it into
 * `features/_generated/jobs.gen.ts`, and the worker drains it generically ,
 * zero hand-wiring at the worker entrypoint.
 *
 * Keep this module's import surface light so codegen can import it under
 * jsdom/bun without side effects (apns is env-gated + opens no top-level
 * connection; db is lazy , same constraint guest-wifi/jobs.ts already
 * satisfies).
