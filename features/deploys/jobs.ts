/**
 * GitHub run-history retention purge (Track C shell-cleanup fold — was
 * apps/api's github-purge-service.ts, driven by the bundled purge.js
 * one-shot). `github_run` accumulates one row per main workflow run; 30 days
 * of history is all the Deploys tile ever shows, so older rows (and their log
 * tails) go.
 *
 * The github_poll_status singleton is NEVER touched here: it carries the
 * currently-deployed pointer, and purging it when the last deploy is >30 days
 * old would leave the tile unable to say what is deployed at all. Purge the
 * history, keep the pointer.
 *
 * Runs from the S2 cron seam (a daily one-shot k8s CronJob), never a worker
 * loop (PRD Backend rule 7). Volume is trivial (a few hundred rows a month),
 * so a single bounded DELETE per table is enough, no batching.
