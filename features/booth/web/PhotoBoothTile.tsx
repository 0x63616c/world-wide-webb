/**
 * PhotoBoothTile , the board face for the photo-booth feature (2x2, titled). A
 * standard TileHeader ("Photo Booth" + camera glyph) over a quiet body: the
 * lock mark sits inside the house nest chip (the same rounded-square recipe the
 * section-label `.ic` and TileDesign01 use). No status dot: the booth carries no
 * live board state, so nothing should read as one.
 *
 * Tapping the Tile opens the fullscreen camera through the App-owned detail facet,
 * whose wiring hosts the camera ⇄ gallery navigation.
 * The tile itself is presentational and takes no props, so it serves as both the
 * Board `component` and the `viewComponent` slot in the App manifest.
 *
 * The title MUST stay in sync with the manifest label
 * (asserted by tile-title-sync.test.tsx).
