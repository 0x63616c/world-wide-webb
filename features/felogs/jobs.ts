/**
 * Frontend-log retention purge (spec 2026-07-18-frontend-log-shipping-design),
 * folded into the felogs feature (Track C, Wave 7 — was apps/api's
 * frontend-log-purge-service.ts). `frontend_log` is append-only device debug
 * logs shipped from every panel / browser session, so it grows without bound.
 * Retention is the size control (all four levels ship, no level filtering),
 * not backup — each device holds its own copy.
 *
 * Retention policy:
 *  - frontend_log: KEEP 30 days, cut on `ts` (capture time). A row's ts only
 *    ever moves backward relative to now, so a ts cutoff can never delete a row
 *    a live query still wants (reads are always "recent" windows).
 *
 * Runs from the S2 cron seam (a daily one-shot k8s CronJob), never a worker
 * loop (PRD Backend rule 7). Deletes are BATCHED: a single unbounded DELETE
 * would hold one long transaction and bloat WAL. Whatever a run doesn't finish
 * is picked up by the next day's run.
 *
 * jobs.ts exports ONLY this `defineCron` facet — felogs ingest is a tRPC
 * mutation, not a queue job or worker interval, so this feature has no
 * `defineJobs` facet.
