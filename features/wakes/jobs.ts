/**
 * Wake-photo retention purge (Track C, Wave 5 fold — was apps/api's
 * wake-photo-purge-service.ts).
 *
 * Wake photos were the only media the control-center kept with no retention at
 * all , the filesystem tree was the store, and a tree has no cheap "older than"
 * query, so nothing ever deleted them. The index row (see photos.ts)
 * is what makes a cutoff affordable.
 *
 * Retention: KEEP 90 days, cut on `captured_at`. Longer than the 30-day
 * frontend-log window on purpose , a photo is the only record of WHO was at the
 * panel, and it is far smaller per-event than the log lines it accompanies.
 *
 * Rows and files are deleted together, ROW FIRST: an orphaned file is invisible
 * (nothing lists from disk any more) and is re-indexed by the boot backfill then
 * purged again next run, whereas an orphaned row 404s in the viewer.
 *
 * Runs from the S2 cron seam (a daily one-shot k8s CronJob), never a worker
 * loop (PRD Backend rule 7). Staggered off guest-wifi (0 2) + weather (0 3) +
 * felogs.
 *
 * jobs.ts exports ONLY this `defineCron` facet , wake capture is a browser-side
 * best-effort burst, not a worker job, so this feature has no `defineJobs`
 * facet.
