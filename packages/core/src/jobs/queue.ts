/**
 * Generic durable job queue (www-kp4k.12; relocated into @www/core at S1). Provides:
 *   - enqueueJob: insert a new job row, claimable immediately or at a future time
 *   - claimOne: atomic FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED claim of ONE row of ONE type,
 *     run under a timeout → ack/nack
 *
 * db-injected (mirrors createPgDeviceStateStore): core has no module-singleton
 * db, so every function takes one. apps/api binds these to its own db behind a
 * thin adapter (apps/api/src/jobs/queue.ts); each folded feature passes its OWN
 * db. Same physical `job` table, different drizzle handle per caller.
 *
 * Claim is done with raw SQL so we get the true FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
 * atomicity that prevents two claimers from taking the same row. The ORM layer
 * (drizzle) does not expose SKIP LOCKED in its query builder, so we drop to
 * sql`` for the claim step only.
 *
 * Retry strategy: exponential backoff capped at 1h.
 *   delay = min(60 * 60, 30 * 2^(attempts - 1)) seconds
 *
 * Idempotency:  handlers are responsible for their own idempotency;
 *   the queue guarantees at-least-once delivery, not exactly-once.
