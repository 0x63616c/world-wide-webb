 * Returns the process-wide drizzle handle for `url`, creating and memoizing
 * the underlying `pg.Pool` on first call. Every feature's `db.ts` (and
 * apps/api's own db module) call this instead of constructing their own
 * `Pool`, so a single process holds exactly one pool per distinct connection
 * string no matter how many features it imports — not one pool per feature.
 *
 * Correctness of the memoization depends on every caller's `url` for the
 * same physical database resolving to the identical string (same
 * host/db/user); in this repo that's guaranteed by every feature and
 * apps/api sourcing `DATABASE_URL` from the single shared env registry key
 * (packages/platform/env/manifest.ts), not a per-feature slice. A future
 * per-feature database split would need to revisit this precondition.
 *
 * The generic `schema` type is per-call-site only — the runtime cache is
 * keyed purely by `url`, so the first caller for a given URL determines the
 * pool's lifecycle and every later caller with that same URL gets back a
 * handle typed against its own `schema` argument over the same pool.
