/**
 * A minimal, dedicated listener that serves nothing but the exposition text.
 *
 * Dedicated PORT, not a route on an existing server, and this is a security
 * boundary rather than a style choice: the api's :4201 is mapped through the
 * Cloudflare tunnel (the public, non-Access-gated `hooks.` host resolves to it),
 * so a `/metrics` route there would put the process's full internal state on
 * the public internet. Nothing creates a Kubernetes Service for this port —
 * Prometheus scrapes the pod IP directly off the pod annotations
 * (`WorkloadSpec.scrape`), so the port is reachable in-cluster only.
 *
 * `node:http` rather than `Bun.serve` so the same listener works on bun and on
 * node.
