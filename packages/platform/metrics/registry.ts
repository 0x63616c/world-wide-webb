 * a service that builds its own `new Registry()` gets its own exposition text,
 * its own default-label set and its own naming conventions, and the union of
 * those is not a queryable metrics estate. Services declare observations
 * through the typed helpers in `http.ts` / `jobs.ts` / `cron.ts`; nothing
 * outside this folder constructs a Counter/Gauge/Histogram.
 *
 * Every metric this repo owns is prefixed `www_`, so `www_*` is exactly "our
 * instrumentation" and everything else in the endpoint is prom-client's own
 * process/runtime collection.
