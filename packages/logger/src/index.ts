/**
 * The logger our own code is allowed to use. Deliberately has NO `debug`
 * method: every line WE write is `info` or above, so it is visible at the prod
 * default level and we never have to raise `LOG_LEVEL` to read our own
 * diagnostics. Raising it to `debug` would also unmute every third-party
 * library that logs through pino (drizzle, node internals, HTTP clients),
 * which is noise we did not ask for and cannot tune per-source.
 *
 * The corollary: a line that isn't worth `info` in steady state does not get
 * demoted to `debug`, it gets made to fire LESS (on transition/change, not per
 * tick). See `logChange` below and docs/logging.md §3.
 *
 * `debug`/`trace` are omitted at the TYPE level rather than banned by a lint
 * rule so a `.debug(...)` call is a compile error at every call site. Code we
 * don't own still logs at debug through its own pino instance, unaffected.
 *
 * @public, Logger type used at every service call site.
