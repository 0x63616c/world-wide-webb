// The per-service secret inventory consumed by eso.ts (native k8s Secrets) and
// vault.ts. This file is now a thin ADAPTER: the single declaration lives in the
// @www/platform product manifest (secretCatalog + the per-service secretUsages),
// and the two maps below are DERIVED from it. Each secret value is a VAULT_KEY in
// secrets/vault.yaml (ITEM__FIELD format); vault.ts reads the vault and creates a
// native k8s Secret per service (CC-k8t7: migrated from ESO+1Password to SOPS+age).
//
// Adding/removing a service secret is a one-line edit in the platform manifest;
// SERVICE_SECRETS, SERVICE_SECRET_TARGETS, and the services.ts mount markers all
// follow. infra/test/secrets-derivation.test.ts pins the exact expected content
// as a golden snapshot so any drift fails loudly.
