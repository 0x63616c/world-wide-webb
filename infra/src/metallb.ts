// MetalLB (Task 4, Talos migration): OrbStack synthesizes `type: LoadBalancer`
// Services for free (its own `expose_services` host-port republishing, see
// services.ts's ADVERTISE_IP comments) , bare-metal Talos has no cloud
// controller to satisfy a LoadBalancer Service, so any LAN LoadBalancer would
// sit in <pending> forever without an L2 LB implementation. MetalLB is that
// implementation: an L2Advertisement makes the node itself answer ARP for the
// pool's addresses via its own NIC. No Service claims a pool address today —
// the pool is kept reserved so the next LAN listener is a one-line addition.
//
// Namespace `metallb-system` is created BY the pinned upstream manifest itself
// (L1: not threaded through cluster.ts's closed InfraNamespaceName map, same
// pattern as lvm-localpv.ts/homeassistant.ts).
//
// TALOS-ONLY: never installed on "orbstack" (its LoadBalancers are already
// satisfied by OrbStack itself; MetalLB would double-advertise the same
// addresses). Gated in program.ts behind `substrate === "talos"`.

 *
 * WHY: Talos labels its control-plane nodes
 * `node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers`, and MetalLB's
 * speaker honours that label by refusing to announce LoadBalancer IPs from the
 * node. On a multi-node cluster that is correct (announce from a worker
 * instead). Here there is exactly ONE node and it is the control plane, so the
 * label means NOTHING announces: the speaker creates its ARP responder on
 * enp4s0, then never answers ARP for any pool address. Symptom is a LAN
 * LoadBalancer resolving to `(incomplete)` in `arp -n` from any LAN host while
 * the Service shows healthy endpoints — a silent failure with no error log.
 *
 * The flag tells the speaker to ignore the label. Preferred over deleting the
 * label from the node: the label is Talos-managed cluster state, and stripping
 * it by hand is exactly the kind of uncodified mutation that drifts back on the
 * next reboot.
