# Stops the Home Assistant OS QEMU guest CLEANLY.
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH: this file. It is installed to ~/homeassistant-os/stop-haos.sh
# by scripts/install-haos.sh; never hand-edit the copy on the box.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-24): the previous version was a bare
#   kill "$(cat "$PIDFILE")"
# i.e. SIGTERM to the QEMU *process*. The guest was never told to shut down, so
# every "clean restart" was in fact a power-cut to Home Assistant. That is what
# corrupted the recorder DB on 2026-07-13 and cost a ~55min rebuild with :8123
# shut the whole time. docs/ha-homelab.md used to call this the clean path; it
# was wrong.
#
# The correct path is ACPI: `system_powerdown` over QEMU's monitor socket, which
# the guest kernel handles as a real shutdown request. SIGTERM and SIGKILL remain
# ONLY as escalating fallbacks, and each one is announced loudly so an unclean
# stop can never happen silently.
#
# Degrades gracefully when the monitor socket is absent — a VM started by the old
# pre-2026-07-24 start-haos.sh has none, and there is nothing to be done for it
# but the fallback. Once such a VM has been cycled once, every later stop is clean.
