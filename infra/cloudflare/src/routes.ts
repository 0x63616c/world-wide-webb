// flattened `app--cc.worldwidewebb.co` cutover host and the `${host}--${dnsCode}`
// scheme were retired in Task 7 Step C; the one imported legacy tooling host
// below (hooks-test) stays explicit as its own removal ticket.

// Ingress and CNAMEs are SEPARATE lists because the live state isn't symmetric:
// every ingress host has a CNAME, but `hooks-test` has a CNAME with NO ingress
// rule (a leftover). Modeling them separately is what makes the import exact.
//
// captive-portal is intentionally absent from BOTH: it is LAN-only, reached over
// the OrbStack LoadBalancer on the mini's en1 (DESIGN §5a), never tunneled.
