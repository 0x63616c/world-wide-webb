// flattened `app--cc.worldwidewebb.co` cutover host and the `${host}--${dnsCode}`
// scheme were retired in Task 7 Step C; the one imported legacy tooling host
// below (hooks-test) stays explicit as its own removal ticket.
//
// Ingress and CNAMEs are SEPARATE lists because the live state was not always
// symmetric: the retired `hooks-test` record was a CNAME with no ingress rule.
// They are symmetric today, but keeping the lists separate leaves room for the
// next asymmetric host without reshaping the model.
//
// captive-portal is intentionally absent from BOTH: it is LAN-only, reached over
// the OrbStack LoadBalancer on the mini's en1 (DESIGN §5a), never tunneled.
