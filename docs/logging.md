# Structured logging (www-rw07)

Status: **implemented** (www-rw07). Foundation (`@repo/logger`) + the backend services shipped in www-rw07.1. Library: **pino**. (bosun was a 4th consumer at the time; it has since been replaced by Pulumi + k8s and removed, so the current backend consumers are api, worker, media-worker.)

This document is the contract for adopting structured logging across the
control-center **backend** (api, worker, media-worker). The web app is
explicitly out of scope (see §9). Read this before writing any logging code or
adding a `console.*` call to a backend service.

---

## 1. Where the shared logger lives

**Decision: a new `packages/logger` workspace, published as `@repo/logger`.**

Rejected alternatives and why:

- **A module inside `@control-center/api`** (e.g. `products/control-center/api/src/logger.ts`). `bosun`
  (`@bosun/bosun`) deliberately has **no `@control-center/api` dependency** and must never
  gain one, it is a deploy agent that ships in its own image and would drag the
  entire tRPC/drizzle/pg tree into bosun's bundle. So the logger cannot live
  under api.
- **Duplicated config per service** (each app configures pino itself). That
  reproduces the redaction list and the dev/prod format switch in four places ,
  guaranteed drift, and a redaction path missed in one copy leaks a secret. The
  whole point is one place that defines "never log secrets".

`packages/logger` is the only option that **all four consumers can import with no
cross-app coupling and no cycles**:

```
@control-center/api        ─┐
@control-center/worker      ├─▶ @repo/logger   (leaf; depends only on pino + pino-pretty)
@control-center/media-worker┤
@bosun/bosun     ─┘
```

`@repo/logger` depends on nothing in the repo. api/worker/media-worker already
depend on `@control-center/api`; they add a direct dep on `@repo/logger`. bosun adds
`@repo/logger` as its **first and only** `@repo/*`/`@bosun/*` cross-workspace dep
(a leaf logger, not the app tree, acceptable). No cycle is possible because the
logger imports nothing back.

**Package shape:**

```
packages/logger/
  package.json        # name "@repo/logger", type module, deps: pino, pino-pretty
  src/index.ts        # the public API (exports below)
  test/redact.test.ts # asserts secrets are scrubbed
```

```jsonc
// packages/logger/package.json
{
  "name": "@repo/logger",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "exports": { ".": "./src/index.ts" },
  "scripts": { "test": "vitest run", "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit" },
  "dependencies": { "pino": "^9", "pino-pretty": "^13" },
  "devDependencies": { "@types/bun": "^1.3.13", "typescript": "^5.9.3", "vitest": "^3.2.4" }
}
```

**knip-cleanliness rules for this package:**

- `pino` AND `pino-pretty` are both normal import edges, knip sees them. We
  import `pino-pretty` directly as a **synchronous stream factory**
  (`import prettyStream from "pino-pretty"`), NOT as a `pino.transport` target
  string. This is deliberate: a transport target spawns a `thread-stream` worker
  that re-resolves `"pino-pretty"` from a file path which does not exist inside a
  bun single-file bundle, so the bundled api/worker/media-worker crash-looped on
  boot (www-rw07). A sync stream is bundled inline and works everywhere, and as a
  bonus needs no `knip.jsonc` ignore (the import edge satisfies knip on its own).
- `createLogger` and `getLogger` are both consumed by real call sites (see §2:
  `getLogger()` is the accessor for deep `@control-center/api` domain code), so they are
  live exports, no `@public` tag needed. The `Logger` type alias is exported for
  consumers' convenience with no internal use, so it gets a
  `/** @public, re-exported Logger type for service call sites */` tag.
- Add the `packages/logger` workspace block to `knip.jsonc` (`"test/**/*.test.ts"`
  entries; `src/index.ts` is auto-detected from `exports`).
- **Closing the foundation ticket requires `bunx knip` clean run from within
  `packages/logger`**, not only the root run, make that an explicit AC.

---

## 2. API surface

One factory, one child pattern, standard bound fields. Pino is the engine; we
expose a **narrow, stable** wrapper so call sites never touch pino config and we
can swap internals later.

```ts
// packages/logger/src/index.ts
import pino, { type Logger as PinoLogger } from "pino";

/** @public, Logger type used at every service call site. */
export type Logger = PinoLogger;

export type CreateLoggerOptions = {
  /** Service name bound on every line, e.g. "api" | "worker" | "media-worker" | "bosun". */
  service: string;
  /** Environment string, bound on every line. Defaults to APP_ENV ?? "development". */
  env?: string;
  /** Explicit level override. Defaults to LOG_LEVEL env, else "debug" (pretty) / "info" (JSON). */
  level?: string;
  /** Force pretty/JSON. Omitted → JSON, opting into pretty only on LOG_PRETTY=1. */
  pretty?: boolean;
};

/**
 * Build the ROOT logger for a process. Call EXACTLY ONCE per service at startup
 * and pass the instance down (or stash via getLogger). Binds { service, env }
 * on every line, installs redaction, and selects JSON (default) vs pino-pretty
 * (LOG_PRETTY=1, via a bundle-safe sync stream).
 */
export function createLogger(opts: CreateLoggerOptions): Logger;

/**
 * Process-wide accessor. createLogger() registers the root; getLogger() returns
 * it. Throws if called before createLogger, a hard signal that a module logged
 * before the process initialised its logger (no silent default root).
 */
export function getLogger(): Logger;
```

**`getLogger()` is the accessor for shared `@control-center/api` domain code, and only it.**
Two patterns coexist, chosen by where the code physically lives:

- **Threaded instance**, the default for code a process owns directly:
  `server.ts` (api), `index.ts` + `runtime.ts` (worker / media-worker, where the
  `Logger` is an explicit constructor arg, no module-global), and `cli.ts` /
  `serve.ts` (bosun). These create the root and pass children down.
- **`getLogger()`**, for the **shared `@control-center/api` domain services**
  (`jobs/queue.ts`, the playlist-poller, youtube-ingest, controls-service, the
  enforcers). This code is imported and run under **two different process roots**
  (the `api` server AND the `media-worker`), so it cannot demand a threaded
  logger from a single owner without one of the two roots being unable to reach
  it. It calls `getLogger()`, which returns **whichever root the live process
  created**, so the same line binds `service: "api"` when the api runs it and
  `service: "media-worker"` when the media-worker runs it. That is exactly the
  behaviour we want, and is why `getLogger()` earns its place rather than being
  dead API (it has real consumers, so knip stays green without a `@public` lie).

Because the only legitimate `getLogger()` callers are these shared domain
modules, `getLogger()` is never called from `worker`'s own `runtime.ts` (that
copy is worker-owned and takes the threaded arg).

**Child loggers carry context**, never thread fields by hand into each message.
`pino`'s `.child()` is the mechanism; we standardise the call sites:

```ts
// per-request (api), bind a request id + method/path once:
const reqLog = log.child({ reqId, method, path });
reqLog.info({ status, durationMs }, "request completed");

// per-worker (worker / media-worker runtime), bind the worker name once:
const workerLog = log.child({ worker: worker.name });
workerLog.error({ err, consecutiveFailures, durationMs }, "worker cycle failed");

// per-deploy (bosun), bind a deploy/correlation id:
const deployLog = log.child({ deployId, stack: stackName });
```

**Standard bound fields** (always present, set by `createLogger` + the child
patterns above):

| field        | bound by         | meaning                                             |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `service`    | `createLogger`   | `api` / `worker` / `media-worker`                   |
| `env`        | `createLogger`   | `production` / `development` / `test`               |
| `reqId`      | request child    | per-request correlation (api)                       |
| `worker`     | worker child     | which loop emitted the line                         |
| `durationMs` | per call         | timing on any measured operation                    |

Errors are passed as `log.error({ err }, "msg")`, pino's standard `err`
serializer renders `message` + `stack`. Never `JSON.stringify(err)` (drops the
stack) and never interpolate the error into the message string.

---

## 3. Format and levels

**Format defaults to JSON; pretty is an explicit opt-in. Decided once in `createLogger`:**

- **Default → raw pino JSON** to stdout (one object per line), the shape
  `docker service logs control-center_<svc>` ships and any aggregator parses.
  This is the production path and the safe default.
- **`LOG_PRETTY=1` (or `true`) → `pino-pretty`** (coloured, human single line,
  `translateTime`), rendered via a **synchronous stream** (`pino(opts, prettyStream(...))`),
  NOT a `pino.transport`. Set it in `tilt` / local dev for readable logs.

**Why not `NODE_ENV`?** The api/worker/media-worker ship as **bun single-file
bundles**, and bun **inlines `process.env.NODE_ENV` to a build-time literal**.
CI builds the bundle without `NODE_ENV=production`, so a `NODE_ENV` check freezes
to "not production" and ignores the container's runtime env. The first cut keyed
pretty/JSON on `NODE_ENV` and crash-looped all three services in prod (the
transport's `thread-stream` worker can't resolve `pino-pretty` inside a bundle →
`ModuleNotFound`). So format is keyed on **`LOG_PRETTY`** (read live, never baked)
and pretty uses a **sync stream** so it can't spawn a worker even if enabled in a
bundle. www-rw07.

**bosun** passes an explicit `pretty: false` to `createLogger` and so always
emits JSON regardless of env.

**The env LABEL uses `APP_ENV`, not `NODE_ENV`.** Because `NODE_ENV` is baked
into the bundle it can't carry the runtime environment into the logs, so the
bound `env` field defaults from `process.env.APP_ENV ?? "development"`;
`deploy.config.ts` sets `APP_ENV=production` on the deployed services.

**Level and env defaulting are resolved in ONE place: `packages/logger`.** All
`process.env` reads for the logger (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_PRETTY`, `APP_ENV`) live
**inside `packages/logger/src/index.ts`**, `createLogger` reads
`process.env.LOG_LEVEL` (else `debug` when pretty / `info` for JSON) and defaults
`env` from `process.env.APP_ENV ?? "development"` when `opts.env` is omitted. Call
sites **never** read these themselves; they pass an optional `level` / `env` /
`pretty` through `createLogger` opts if they need to override.

This matters for the lint gate: biome's `style.noProcessEnv` is `error`
repo-wide and only disabled (in `biome.json` overrides) for `products/control-center/api/src/env.ts`,
`packages/bosun/src/cli.ts`, and `scripts/**`. A `process.env.LOG_LEVEL` read in
`server.ts`, the worker/media-worker `index.ts`, or bosun `serve.ts` would fail
`bunx biome check .` (a hard gate). Centralising the reads in `packages/logger`
keeps every other call site env-free, and the foundation ticket adds a biome
override block for `**/packages/logger/src/**` with `style.noProcessEnv: off`
(same pattern as the existing `env.ts` / `cli.ts` overrides) so the one file that
does read env is sanctioned.

`LOG_LEVEL: z.string().optional()` is still added to the api env schema for
documentation/validation, but the logger reads `process.env.LOG_LEVEL` directly
(it cannot import the api env schema, it is a leaf with no `@control-center/api` dep).

**Levels policy** (the rule every gap in §5 maps onto):

| level   | use for                                                                                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `error` | an operation was **lost** or a loop/process is degraded: permanently-failed job, no-handler, worker cycle threw, top-level fatal, enforcer/sync cycle failure. Pages-worthy. |
| `warn`  | recoverable / retried / degraded-but-serving: HA non-2xx, job retry scheduled, command timeout, DB read fell back to "unavailable", missing optional secret (enrichment skipped), 404 webhook, malformed override arg. |
| `info`  | lifecycle + business outcomes an operator wants in steady state: startup line, shutdown, migrations start/done, request completed (api), job claimed/completed, poller cycle summary, secrets/routes reconcile summary, deploy timing, worker failure→recovery transition. |
| `debug` | high-cardinality detail for active debugging, off in prod by default: per-enforcer decision (push/adopt), per-`op read` timing, queue-empty tick, scheduler heartbeat, periodic worker stats snapshot, Spotify refresh success. |

Steady-state prod runs at `info`. Flip `LOG_LEVEL=debug` on one service to light
up the decision-level detail without redeploying code.

## 4. Redaction, secrets are NEVER logged

Two layers, defence in depth:

1. **Discipline (primary):** resolved secret values, tokens, and `Authorization`
   header values are **never passed to the logger at all**. Log the *ref/key/name*,
   the *status code*, the *duration*, never the value. bosun logs `op://` ref
   paths and **hashed docker secret names**, never `resolvedValue`. This is the
   rule the §5 per-service notes enforce ("keys only, never values").
2. **`pino redact` (backstop):** in case a secret-bearing object is ever logged
   by accident, `createLogger` installs a redaction path list that replaces the
   value with `[REDACTED]`. Backstop, not a licence to log secret objects.

> **Redaction is key-NAME-based, not value-based.** pino `redact` matches by
> exact path / key name, so a secret logged under a key the list does not name
> (e.g. bosun wraps `resolvedValue` into a generic `{ name, value }` shape in
> `reconcile/secrets.ts`, or an HA token logged inside a config dump under key
> `token`) slips straight through. Path-based redaction is brittle against
> renamed / wrapped fields. **Therefore layer 1 (discipline, never pass the
> value) is load-bearing, not optional**, and the list below adds a generic
> catch-all of common wrapper key names on top of the named secrets.

```ts
const REDACT_PATHS = [
  // auth headers anywhere in a logged object (top-level + nested .headers)
  "headers.authorization", "*.headers.authorization", "req.headers.authorization",
  "headers['x-api-key']", "*.headers['x-api-key']",
  // named secret fields if an object carrying config is ever logged
  "HA_TOKEN", "*.HA_TOKEN",
  "UNIFI_API_KEY", "*.UNIFI_API_KEY",
  "WIFI_PASSWORD", "*.WIFI_PASSWORD",
  "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET", "*.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN", "*.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN", "*.SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "accessToken", "*.accessToken", "refreshToken", "*.refreshToken",
  "OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "*.OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "DATABASE_URL", "*.DATABASE_URL",
  "POSTGRES_PASSWORD", "*.POSTGRES_PASSWORD",
  "OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN", "*.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN",
  "GHCR_PULL_TOKEN", "*.GHCR_PULL_TOKEN",
  // generic secret-plaintext wrapper keys: a resolved secret value can ride a
  // renamed/wrapped key, so both common shapes are censored as defence-in-depth.
  "resolvedValue", "*.resolvedValue",
  "value", "*.value",
  "apiToken", "*.apiToken",                       // Cloudflare token
  // generic wrapper-key catch-all, a secret logged under a renamed/wrapped key
  // (the brittleness called out above). Cheap insurance behind layer-1 discipline.
  "token", "*.token", "secret", "*.secret",
  "password", "*.password", "credential", "*.credential",
  // private-but-not-credential home location (no-home-address guard territory)
  "HOME_LAT", "*.HOME_LAT", "HOME_LON", "*.HOME_LON",
  "HOME_PLACE_NAME", "*.HOME_PLACE_NAME",
];
```

> `REDACT_PATHS` was finalised against the real field names, including the
> generic secret-value wrapper keys (`resolvedValue`, `value`) so a value logged
> under a renamed/wrapped key is still censored. The api config shapes were
> verified the same way.

`createLogger` passes `{ redact: { paths: REDACT_PATHS, censor: "[REDACTED]" } }`
to pino. A `packages/logger/test/redact.test.ts` asserts each sensitive field is
censored, that test is the machine-checkable AC for the foundation ticket. The
test asserts against objects shaped like a resolved secret
(`{ name, ref, resolvedValue }`) and its `{ name, value }` re-wrap, and the
api config object, not just bare `{ HA_TOKEN: … }`, so the named-field and
wrapper-key paths are both exercised against the shapes that actually flow.

**Sensitive field inventory** (union across services): `HA_TOKEN`,
`UNIFI_API_KEY`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
`OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, `GHCR_PULL_TOKEN`, Cloudflare `apiToken`, any
`Authorization` / `X-API-KEY` header value, a resolved-secret `resolvedValue`, and the
private home fields `HOME_LAT` / `HOME_LON` / `HOME_PLACE_NAME`. The gitleaks +
no-home-address pre-commit guards remain the commit-time backstop.

---

## 5. Per-service adoption

Every backend service does the same two things: (a) replace existing `console.*`
with `getLogger()`/child loggers at the mapped level, and (b) fill the named
observability gaps. The single highest-value change is the **worker/media-worker
runtime**, which today swallows every cycle error into invisible in-memory stats.

> **Shared-code ownership, these tickets are NOT fully parallel on shared files.**
> The job queue, playlist-poller, youtube-ingest, controls-service, and the
> enforcers physically live in **`@control-center/api`** and are run by **two** process
> roots (the api server and the media-worker). To avoid parallel worktrees both
> editing `jobs/queue.ts` / the poller / ingest and conflicting on every merge,
> **ALL `@control-center/api` domain-service logging is owned by the API ticket only.**
> Those modules acquire their logger via **`getLogger()`** (see §2) so they bind
> whichever root is live (`service: "api"` under the api, `service: "media-worker"`
> under the media-worker), no threaded arg, reachable from both roots. The
> worker and media-worker tickets are therefore reduced to **only their own
> `runtime.ts` + `index.ts`** (the framework copies they each own). The API
> ticket must land the shared-code logging FIRST; worker / media-worker then
> adopt only the runtime. See the rollout note in §8.

### api (`@control-center/api`)

Root logger created once in `server.ts`: `const log = createLogger({ service: "api" })`.
This ticket **owns all `@control-center/api` domain-service logging** (queue, poller,
ingest, controls, enforcers, see the §5 ownership note); those modules log via
**`getLogger()`** so they also bind correctly when the media-worker runs them.
`server.ts`-owned code uses the threaded `log` / `reqLog` children directly.

**Replace:**
- `server.ts:53` tRPC onError `console.error` → `reqLog.error({ err, path }, "trpc error")`.
- `server.ts:76` 500 `console.error` → `reqLog.error({ err, status: 500, durationMs }, "request failed")`.
- `server.ts:82` per-request `console.warn` → **`reqLog.info({ status, durationMs }, "request completed")`** for real methods (it was mis-levelled at warn for 200s; completed requests are `info`). **CORS `OPTIONS` preflights log at `debug`, not `info`** (transport noise, see §6 volume note). Build `reqLog = log.child({ reqId, method, path })` at the top of `fetch()`.
- `server.ts:87` startup `console.warn` → `log.info({ port, env }, "api started")`.
- `party-service.ts:131` `console.error("Transient HA error…")` → `log.error({ err, tick, speed }, "party engine tick failed")` (now carries the real error).
- `playlist-poller-service.ts:77` `console.warn` → `log.warn({ err, sourceId }, "yt-dlp failed for source")`.
- `db/seed.ts` console.* → `info`/`error` (seed-only, low priority but keep consistent).

**Add (new structured logs):**
- `db/migrate.ts`, `info` migrations start (folder) + `info` done / `error` on throw.
- `env.ts` hydrate path, `info` which secret-file vars resolved vs left default (**names only, never values**).
- `/health/climate` route, `debug` HA probe latency + ok/fail.
- `trpc/init.ts` `haErrorMiddleware`, `warn` with tRPC path, original `HaError.status`, message (preserve the HTTP status lost in the remap).
- `integrations/homeassistant/index.ts` `request()` catch, `warn` HA path, status (0 = network), `durationMs` on every non-2xx/timeout (single HA I/O chokepoint).
- `device-sync-service.ts`, `light-enforcer-service.ts`, `climate-enforcer-service.ts`, `error` on cycle catch / `markHeartbeat(error)` with message + `consecutiveFailures`.
- `light-enforcer-service.ts applyDecision`, `debug` per push (entityId, on/off, brightness, **colour as kelvin/rgb tuple only**) and per adopt (entityId, adopted reported state).
- `device-sync-service.ts sweepExpiredWindows`, `warn` on command marked Timeout (deviceId, entityId, desired, elapsed).
- `jobs/queue.ts`, `error` no-handler; `warn` retry (jobId, type, attempt, delaySec, err); `error` permanent failure (jobId, type, attempts, err); plus `claimAndRun` `info` claimed (jobId, type, attempts) / `info` completed (jobId, type, durationMs) / `debug` queue-empty (these fire under BOTH the api and media-worker roots via `getLogger()`).
- `youtube-ingest-service.ts`, `debug` idempotent skip; `error` media_item not found; `info` yt-dlp audio/video start+complete (videoId, path, bytes, durationMs); `warn` metadata-fetch failure (null duration); `info` OpenRouter enrich start/complete (model, durationMs); `warn` enrich skipped when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` absent (**never the key value**). Runs under the media-worker root in practice but the code is api-owned.
- `integrations/spotify/client.ts refreshToken`, `debug` success with `expires_in` (**never the token**).
- `playlist-poller-service.ts`, `info` cycle start/summary (sourceId, found, new vs known); `debug` empty playlist; `info` new items discovered (sourceId, newCount, videoIds).
- `controls-service.ts`, `warn` getControlsState DB-read failure (devices appear unavailable); `warn` writeDesired per-entity DB write failure (entityId, desired).

> All of the above `@control-center/api` domain modules acquire their logger via
> `getLogger()` (§2), so each line binds whichever process root is live.

### worker (`@control-center/worker`)

Root logger `createLogger({ service: "worker" })` in `index.ts`. **The runtime
change is the heart of this whole effort**, `runtime.ts` currently catches every
cycle error into `stats` and emits nothing.

**Replace:**
- `index.ts` startup `console.warn` → `log.info({ workers: [...] }, "worker started")`.
- `index.ts` signal `console.warn` → `log.info({ signal }, "worker stopping")`.

**Add, `runtime.ts` is passed a `Logger` and binds a child per worker:**
- **cycle catch** → `workerLog.error({ err, consecutiveFailures, durationMs }, "worker cycle failed")`. Fixes the invisible-failure bug.
- **failure transition** (`consecutiveFailures` 0→1) → distinct `error` "worker entered failing state" so the exact onset is greppable.
- **recovery transition** (`consecutiveFailures` >0→0) → `info` "worker recovered" with the streak length just cleared.
- **start()** → `info` per worker registered (name, intervalMs, runOnStart).
- **stop()** → `info` timers cleared, which workers had an in-flight timer.
- **periodic stats** (finally, every N runs / ~60s) → `debug` snapshot (totalRuns, consecutiveFailures, lastDurationMs, rss/heapUsed).
- **slow-cycle** (lastDurationMs > intervalMs) → `warn` (name, lastDurationMs, intervalMs, ratio).
- `index.ts` after `runMigrations()` → `info` migrations done / `error` on throw.
- SIGINT/SIGTERM handler → `info` final per-worker stats snapshot at shutdown.

The runtime takes the logger as a **constructor argument** (`createWorkerRuntime(workers, { logger })`), no module-global logger, keeps it testable, and lets media-worker pass its own `service: "media-worker"` root.

### media-worker (`@control-center/media-worker`)

Root logger `createLogger({ service: "media-worker" })` in `index.ts`. It owns a
**copy** of the worker framework (`runtime.ts`/`types.ts`), apply the same
runtime changes as worker (failure/recovery transitions, periodic stats,
slow-cycle). **This ticket is scoped to the files media-worker OWNS only**
(`index.ts` + its `runtime.ts`/`types.ts` copy). The job queue, poller, and
ingest live in `@control-center/api` and their logging is owned by the **API ticket**
(§5 ownership note) via `getLogger()`, those lines fire automatically under the
`media-worker` root at runtime, so this ticket neither edits nor re-logs them.

**Replace:**
- `index.ts:78` disk-below-threshold `console.warn` → `log.warn({ freeBytes, thresholdBytes, dir }, "disk below threshold, skipping claim")` (add the numbers).
- `index.ts:100` startup + `index.ts:108` signal → `info`.

**Add (media-worker-owned files only):**
- `index.ts hasSufficientDisk` statfs catch → `warn` "statfs failed, assuming sufficient" (dir, err), makes the allow-on-error assumption explicit.
- runtime cycle catch / 3+ streak → `error` (same runtime changes as worker, above).
- `index.ts` migrations start/done.

## 6. How we know it's working

Each service emits, in `kubectl logs deploy/<svc>`, a single
unmistakable **startup line** and ongoing **steady-state** lines. An operator
greps the startup line first (timestamp anchor), then watches the steady-state
stream to confirm liveness:

| service        | startup line                              | steady-state visible at `info`                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| api            | `"api started" {port,env}`                | `"request completed" {status,durationMs}` per request            |
| worker         | `"worker started" {workers:[…]}`          | failure→recovery transitions; (decision/heartbeat detail at `debug`) |
| media-worker   | `"media-worker started" {workers:[…]}`    | `"job claimed"`/`"job completed"`, poller cycle summaries        |

Liveness contract:
- **Startup line present** → process booted and configured its logger.
- **Failure-transition + recovery lines** (worker/media-worker) → a degraded
  loop is now *visible in stdout*, not buried in `stats()`. This is the bug §5
  fixes; the AC for the worker tickets asserts these lines exist.
- **`info` is the prod default**, so all of the above show without enabling
  debug. Flip `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to add per-decision / per-`op read` / heartbeat
  detail during an incident.

**Expected `info`-volume / log-rate (so an operator isn't surprised):** the api
logs `"request completed"` at `info` on **every** request through the single
`fetch()` chokepoint. On a kiosk dashboard the steady-state driver is per-tile
polling plus the tRPC client, whose `QueryClient` **retries infinitely** (per
project CLAUDE.md), so:

- **CORS `OPTIONS` preflights** are logged at **`debug`, not `info`** (or skipped)
 , they are pure transport noise and would otherwise roughly double the line
  count. Only the real method's completion is an `info` liveness line.
- During an HA / backend outage the infinite-retry `QueryClient` must NOT spin a
  tight error-retry loop that floods `"request failed"` at `error`. The api's
  per-tile reads fail fast and the client backs off; confirm the retry cadence is
  bounded (React Query's exponential backoff caps the interval) so an outage
  produces a steady trickle, not an error storm. If any path retries with no
  backoff, that is a bug to fix before adopting `error` on it.
- Document the **expected steady-state req/s** (tiles × poll interval) in this
  section once measured, so the `info` rate is a known quantity.

The **1s worker loops stay silent** in steady state (only transitions + periodic
`debug` stats), which is the correct bound on the highest-frequency emitters.

## 7. Web (browser), out of scope, future note

`products/control-center/web` is **not** in this effort. pino's browser build exists, but the web
app's `console.*` usage is a separate, smaller concern (it ships to a kiosk
WKWebView, no aggregator). When picked up later: a thin `products/control-center/web/src/log.ts`
wrapper with the same `info/warn/error` shape (no pino dependency required ,
could be a 20-line console wrapper that no-ops `debug` in prod) can replace
`console.*` at the React call sites, optionally POSTing `error` lines to an api
sink. Keep it a separate ticket; do not block the backend rollout on it.

## 8. Rollout ordering

1. **Foundation** (`@repo/logger`) lands first with its redaction test green ,
   nothing else can import it until it exists. (Includes the
   `**/packages/logger/src/**` `noProcessEnv: off` biome override and the
   `packages/logger`-scoped `pino-pretty` knip ignore, see §1, §3.)
2. **api** lands next: it owns ALL `@control-center/api` domain-service logging (queue,
   poller, ingest, controls, enforcers) via `getLogger()` (§5 ownership note).
   This must precede worker/media-worker because those shared files are edited
   here ONLY.
3. Then **worker / media-worker / bosun** adopt. They are parallel **with each
   other** (each touches only files it owns, its own `runtime.ts`/`index.ts`,
   or bosun's `cli.ts`/`serve.ts`), but they are **NOT** parallel with the api
   ticket on the shared `@control-center/api` files: those are already done by step 2, so
   worker/media-worker adopt only the runtime and inherit the domain lines at
   runtime.
4. Docs updated to reflect actual implementation (no deviations from the plan above).

**These tickets are NOT fully parallel.** The api ticket is on the critical path
for all shared `@control-center/api` domain code; worker/media-worker/bosun parallelise
only among themselves after it lands. Each service ticket is independently
revertable, but the ordering above avoids parallel worktrees conflicting on
`jobs/queue.ts` / the poller / ingest.
