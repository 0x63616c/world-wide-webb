/**
 * Weather-reading retention purge. Both weather tables are append-only by
 * design (the ingest poller inserts a fresh row per forecast hour every cycle
 * so run-over-run forecast drift is preserved), which means they grow without
 * bound: ~192 hourly rows + 8 daily rows per cycle, 288 cycles/day, is roughly
 * 55k weather_reading rows/day forever.
 *
 * Retention policy:
 *  - weather_reading / weather_daily_reading: KEEP 30 days of history, cut on
 *    `recorded_at` (when we captured the row), NOT on target_hour/target_date.
 *    Rows describing future hours are always recently recorded, so a recorded_at
 *    cutoff can never delete a row the dashboard still reads
 *    (weather-read-service only queries from today/now forward).
 *
 * Runs from the same daily one-shot CronJob as the portal purge (see purge.ts),
 * never a worker loop (PRD Backend rule 7).
 *
 * Deletes are BATCHED. The first production run has millions of rows to remove
 * and a single unbounded DELETE would hold one long transaction and bloat WAL.
 * Each batch is its own statement; whatever a run doesn't finish is picked up by
 * the next day's run.
