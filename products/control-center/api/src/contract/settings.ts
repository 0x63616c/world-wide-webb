/**
 * The wall-panel settings CONTRACT , the single definition of the vocabulary and
 * bounds that both sides of the wire must agree on.
 *
 * This module has ZERO imports, deliberately. It is re-exported through
 * `packages/api` (`@cc/api/settings`) and therefore lands in the browser bundle,
 * so anything reachable from here ships to the panel. Keep it plain literals:
 * no zod, no drizzle, no logger. The api's settings-service builds its zod
 * schema from these values; the web store builds its clamps and its picker from
 * the same ones.
 *
 * It exists because settings-service's own header calls this blob "the
 * byte-for-byte contract the web client reads/writes; field names and types MUST
 * NOT drift" , and until now nothing enforced that. The snap-mode union was
 * declared three separate times, and the idle-timeout ceiling had already
 * drifted (web clamped to 10 min while the server accepted 60).
