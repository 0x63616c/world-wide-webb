 * Why a separate store rather than more fields on the settings singleton: the
 * settings row is global (id = "singleton") and every panel reads the same one.
 * Volume cannot work that way , it is a property of a specific piece of hardware
 * in a specific room, and two panels at the same level would be a coincidence,
 * not a preference. `pushEnabled` hit the same wall earlier and was solved by
 * keeping it device-local in the web store; that works but is invisible to the
 * server and lost on reinstall. Keying on `device_id` fixes both.
