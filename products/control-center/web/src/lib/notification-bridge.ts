/**
 * Pure translation rules for the banner → notification-center bridge.
 *
 * The board's three ephemeral banners (ConnectionLostBanner, AppUpdateBanner,
 * DeviceNameBanner) raise into the in-memory store in lib/useNotifications.ts.
 * That store is deliberately NOT the notification center: it is live board
 * state ("is this banner on screen right now"), it has no history, and it must
 * keep working with the API down , it is the only thing that can tell you the
 * API is down.
 *
 * This module holds the rules for turning one of those live entries into a
 * persistent `notifications.raise` payload. It is pure so the mapping (and
 * especially the connection-outage special case) is unit-testable without React
 * or a tRPC provider; the component that applies it is
 * components/NotificationBridge.tsx.
