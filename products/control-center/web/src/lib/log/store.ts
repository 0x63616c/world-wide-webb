/**
 * Durable log history , IndexedDB.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the native kiosk shell (web/ios/App/App) runs a
 * KioskWatchdog that reloads the webview when the dashboard stops responding.
 * Every failure the panel already automates around therefore destroys the
 * in-memory ring. Without a persistent layer the logs would be systematically
 * empty for exactly the incidents worth reading about.
 *
 * Written with the raw IndexedDB API rather than a wrapper: the surface we need
 * is four operations, and the web bundle ships to a wall panel where a new
 * runtime dependency has to earn its place.
 *
 * Rotation evicts on BOTH entry count and total bytes, whichever trips first.
 * Count-only eviction is how you discover the disk filled up, because a single
 * fat payload can be thousands of times larger than a typical line. `bytes` is
 * carried per record and the running total is kept in a meta record written in
 * the SAME transaction as every append/prune, so the two cannot drift apart
 * across a crash.
 *
 * Storage durability caveat: the Capacitor shell loads REMOTE content
 * (capacitor.config.ts `server.url` -> the hosted dashboard) rather than a
 * bundled local scheme, so the WKWebView origin is an ordinary https origin and
 * WebKit's 7-day cap on script-writable storage applies to it. Daily use of the
 * panel keeps resetting that clock, and requestPersistence() asks WebKit to
 * exempt us outright, but neither is a guarantee. The backstop is native.ts:
 * every flush also appends to a native JSONL mirror through the Capacitor
 * bridge (which ITP does not touch), and boot restores from it when this store
 * comes up evicted.
